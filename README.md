## Important web links

### Ben Eater's Website
- [Ben Eater's main website](https://eater.net/)  
- Ben Eater's [Build an 8-bit computer from scratch](https://eater.net/8bit) project page.  
- The [Complete parts list](https://eater.net/8bit/parts)
  - I've heard from a few people online that the pre-built parts kit is *complete* but also seems to make some compromises with the quality of the parts.
  - Rather than deal with the repurcussions of low-quality components, I'm hoping to find the components from a name brand manufacturer, even if that means paying more money.
  - I also don't need duplicates of some items, like jumper wires and LEDs when I already have larger kits and hookup wire and so on.
 
- While I will not be buying the pre-built kits, I have made a [one-time donation to support](https://eater.net/support) Mr. Eater's efforts with the project.
